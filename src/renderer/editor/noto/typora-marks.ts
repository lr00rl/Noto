 * Typora's inline extensions, found in a run of text: `==highlight==`,
 * `^superscript^` and `~subscript~`.
 *
 * None of these is CommonMark, so the parser keeps them as plain text and
 * the file keeps its delimiters byte for byte. The editor draws them as
 * Typora does through decorations: the inner text takes the mark, the
 * delimiters hide, and both come back while the caret is in the block,
 * which is the same reveal every other inline syntax gets.
 *
 * Pure, so the scanning is tested on its own. Offsets are code units into
 * the text given, which is how ProseMirror counts positions in a text node.
