/**
 * The menu on a row of the file tree.
 *
 * Built here rather than inside the session so it can be read back in a test:
 * a native menu holds the input loop until somebody dismisses it, and no
 * automated pointer can reach one, so the only way to know what a row offers
 * is to build the template and look at it. The editor's own context menu is
 * kept apart for the same reason.
 *
 * Every action takes the path it was built with. Nothing here reads the path
 * again or resolves it: by the time this is called the caller has already
 * resolved it through any symlink and checked it against the open folder.
