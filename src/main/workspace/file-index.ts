/**
 * A flat index of every openable file under the workspace root.
 *
 * The tree lists one directory at a time on purpose, because a recursive walk
 * on expand would stall the window. Search is the opposite case: it cannot rank
 * what it has not seen, so it needs the whole vault at once. Building it once
 * per folder and handing the renderer the finished list keeps the walk off the
 * typing path entirely; the alternative, an IPC round trip per keystroke,
 * is the one thing guaranteed to make a search box feel slow.
 *
 * Confinement is the tree's: resolve through symlinks, then require the result
 * to still be inside the root, so a link inside the folder cannot be used as a
 * door out of it.
