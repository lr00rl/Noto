# Large documents

## Typing on a very large document, measured 2026-09-02

The corpus files under `out/bench/corpus` are 66KB, 525KB, 2MB and 8MB. The
author's own vault has three notes over a megabyte, the largest 2.9MB, and
thirty-three over 200KB.

| document | blocks | opens in | median keystroke |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| medium, 525KB | 2,742 | 1.1s | 21ms |
| large, 2MB | 10,982 | 3.9s | 113ms |
| huge, 8MB | 43,970 | 24s | 1.4s |

Where the time goes. Every decoration plugin's share of a keystroke was timed
on the 8MB document by applying transactions to a state with each plugin alone:
alerts, Typora's inline marks, the active block and the syntax highlighter
together cost 14ms per twenty keystrokes, or 0.7ms each. The remaining 1.4s is
the view: ProseMirror reconciling a document of forty-four thousand top level
nodes. Nothing in the editor's own logic accounts for it.

One real fault was found and fixed by that measurement. The alert plugin
rebuilt its whole decoration set on every keystroke, which cost 11ms a letter
in the state and far more in the view, since a wholly new set gives ProseMirror
nothing to compare and it revisits every block. It is incremental now, like the
highlighter and the marks: the set is mapped through the transaction and only
the blocks the change or the selection touched are rescanned. On the 8MB
document the 95th percentile keystroke fell from 5.2s to 1.5s.

What is left is the view layer, and it is the honest limit of this design at
this size. A 2MB note, which is larger than all but three notes in the vault,
takes 113ms a keystroke: perceptible, and short of where it should be.
